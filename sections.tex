\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
This is an example citation for a work by Anastasiu and Karypis~\cite{anastasiu-dsaa2016}. Note the non-breaking space character (\textasciitilde) between the word before the citation and the \textit{{\textbackslash}cite} command. It gets translated into a space, and does not allow \LaTeX~ to print the citation on a different line than the word it is connected to. This, of course, does not work if you put a space between the word and the non-breaking space character, e.g., ``Karypis \textasciitilde{\textbackslash}cite\{anastasiu-dsaa2016\}".
