I would like to thank my advisor, for being the greatest advisor in the world.

I would also like to thank Cheryl R. Cowan, SJSU Graduate Studies Associate, for assisting me in creating this LaTeX template and ensuring that it accurately follows the Graduate Studies thesis style requirements.

Last, but not least, I would like to thank my family. Without their support, I would have never been able to complete this thesis or pursue my dreams.
