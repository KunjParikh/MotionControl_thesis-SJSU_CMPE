This ``thesis" provides a visual example of how a San Jos\'{e} State University (SJSU) Computer Engineering (CMPE) department thesis should be formatted. Our LaTeX thesis template follows the IEEE Computer Society (compsoc) journal style in most respects, yet it complies with the SJSU Graduate and Undergraduate Programs (GUP) thesis guidelines where those guidelines supersede our chosen publication style. Note that the latest GUP guidelines always take precedence over this template or style. If conflicts arise, please inform the template maintainer so they can be promptly corrected. In general, students should thoroughly read the latest Graduate Studies thesis guidelines before writing their thesis. The guidelines contain a lot of important information beyond style requirements, including directions for tone of language in the thesis, suggestions for correcting common language-related errors, and procedures and deadlines for submitting the thesis. The LaTeX template project that this thesis is part of was created as a way to simplify GUP thesis style compliance for CMPE and College of Engineering students. Beyond style information, this document will also provide instructions to properly use the LaTeX style and some general instructions for doing research and writing LaTeX documents.
